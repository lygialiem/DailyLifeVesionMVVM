## Introduction and Demo

Hi there! I'm Liem, I'm from VietNam. I had 4 months to get familier with programming languages, specifically Swift and platform Xcode. I think it's very great, beautiful and especially easy to read. So I developed an app called "Daily Life". Let's watch it below:

## Description

 DailyLife is an App in IOS. Yes of course! It's all about news. It can supply many articles from the popular sources such as cnn.com, nytimes.com, vice.com... . It also give us the information of forecast weather based on GPS or specificed Cities. Additionally, it also have the World Clock functionality to give us the timezone of some city. All that information that it get are from the server through API: 
 
* Forecast weather: Darksky API, Apixu API.
 
* News: NewsApi
    
The design of this app is familiar, easy to read with the user. The basic colors are yellow and black which are model.

I'm converting the App from MVC to MVVM... .App will be updated continuously
